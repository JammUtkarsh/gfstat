gfStat is a tool for GitHub users that provides insights into your GitHub followers and following. With gfStat, you can easily discover:

- **Mutual followers**: See who follows you and whom you follow back.
- **Followers you don't follow**: Find out who follows you, but you don't follow back.
- **Following that don't follow you**: Identify GitHub users you follow, but they don't follow you in return.

## Why gfStat?

It's a side project to learn a bunch of new technologies and tools and practice writing. I am using Go again because I've been doing data structures and algorithms for a long enough time now which made me unable to write effective Go code.

## Tech Involved

- About 99% of the project is built in [Go](https://go.dev/) the rest of it is simple HTML templating.
- The only external dependeny that I have used is [GitHub's Go SDK](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/go-github/v56#section-readme), the rest of application is built standard library.
